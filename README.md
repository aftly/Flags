## üõ† Design
- Built with Jetpack Compose in Kotlin, following architecture principles described on Android Developers such as UDF, SSOT, separation of concerns, and ViewModels for managing business state and logic.

- Flag info uses local data, originally sourced from Wikipedia via Python scripts for getting flag images, common names, official names and alternate names.
Flag category info is derived more manually, by filtering from broader categories such as on [countries by system of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_system_of_government) and other Wikipedia lists.
