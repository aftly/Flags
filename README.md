## üõ† Design
- Built with Jetpack Compose in Kotlin, following architecture best practises described on Android Developers, such as UDF, SSOT, ViewModels for managing state and business logic. (UI-only state is kept in local scope.)

- Flag info uses local data, originally sourced from Wikipedia via a collection of Python scripts for getting flag images, common names, official names and alternate names.
Flag category info is derived more manually, by filtering from broader categories such as on [countries by system of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_system_of_government) and other Wikipedia lists.
