## üõ† Design
Built with Jetpack Compose in Kotlin, following architecture best practises described on Android Developers such as SSOT, UDF, ViewModels for managing general state (with UI-only state kept within it's local Composable scope).

Flag data is local, originally sourced from Wikipedia via a series of Python scripts (I wrote) for getting flag images, common name, official name and alternate names.
Flag categories are derived more manually, by filtering from broader categories such as on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_system_of_government and other Wikipedia lists.

## üì± Screenshots
